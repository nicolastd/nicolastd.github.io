<br>
Parametric optical processes in solids reveal critical information about a crystal's properties like optical susceptibility and band-structure, profoundly influencing nonlinear frequency-conversion. Published in Nature Communications, the study titled "Phonon-Enhanced Nonlinearities in Hexagonal Boron Nitride" sheds light on the optical nonlinearities induced and amplified by strong phonon resonances within hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This research comprising both nonlinear optics experiments and TDDFT calculations presents a new frontier in understanding crystal behaviors and their impact on nonlinear frequency-conversion processes.

<strong style="color:#800000;">Intense lasers shine new light on the electron dynamics of liquids</strong>
<br>
An international team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD) in Hamburg and ETH Zurich has now demonstrated that it is possible to probe electron dynamics in liquids using intense laser fields and to retrieve the electron mean free path – the average distance an electron can travel before colliding with another particle. They found that the mechanism by which liquids emit a particular light spectrum known as the high-harmonic spectrum is markedly different from the one in other phases of matter like gases and solids. The team’s findings open the door to a deeper understanding of ultrafast dynamics in liquids.

<strong style="color:#800000;">Absence of universal topological signatures in high harmonic generation</strong>
<br>
Topology plays an enormous role in modern condensed matter physics and beyond. It describes how solid materials can combine two very different and somewhat contradictory properties – for example, topological insulators are materials whose bulk acts as an insulator, but whose surfaces and edges can conduct electricity nonetheless. In the last few decades, the concept of topology has changed the way scientists think of electronic structure and material properties altogether. Moreover, it has paved the way towards technological applications that incorporate topological materials in electronics.

<strong style="color:#800000;">Intense lasers magnetize solids within attoseconds</strong>
<br>
Intense laser light can induce magnetism in solids on the attosecond scale – the fastest magnetic response to date. That is the finding reached by theoreticians at the MPSD, who used advanced simulations to investigate the magnetization process in several 2D and 3D materials. Their calculations show that, in structures with heavy atoms, the fast electron dynamics initiated by the laser pulses can be converted to attosecond magnetism. The work has been published in npj Computational Materials.

Theoreticians at the MPSD predict that a unique laser source could produce highly controllable electric currents in any bulk material. The team’s work, now published in PRL, yields new insights for the development of ultrafast opto-electronic devices, for more efficient photovoltaics, and for the study of electron behavior in solids.

<strong style="color:#800000;">New approach to calculate electron traffic jam in transition metal dichalcogenide</strong>
<br>
Though they both consist only of H2O molecules, water and ice exhibit apparently distinct characters: The former is solid and the latter is the very indispensible liquid for all living creature. Likewise, many materials of a given constituent in nature can exhibit different phases. Diamond and graphite are good examples. Both are made up of carbon atoms, but the former is transparent and electrically insulating while the latter looks black and conducts electricity. Now researchers at the MPSD and the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in South Korea have found that the existing method to calculate a particular insulating state produces errors and suggest a new approach instead. Their work has been published in Physical Review Letters.

<strong style="color:#800000;">A step towards controlling spin-dependent petahertz electronics by material defects</strong>

The operational speed of semiconductors in various electronic and optoelectronic devices is limited to several gigahertz

This constrains the upper limit of the operational speed of computing.
Now researchers from the MPSD and the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay have explained
how these processes can be sped up through the use of light waves and defected solid materials.
