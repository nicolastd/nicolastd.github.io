<strong style="color:#800000;">When light and electrons spin together</strong>
<br>
Theoreticians at the MPSD have demonstrated how the coupling between intense lasers, the motion of electrons, and their spin influences the emission of light on the ultrafast timescale. Their work has been published in npj computational materials.

<strong style="color:#800000;">Laser loops create ultrafast electric currents in materials</strong>
<br>
Theoreticians at the MPSD predict that a unique laser source could produce highly controllable electric currents in any bulk material. The team’s work, now published in PRL, yields new insights for the development of ultrafast opto-electronic devices, for more efficient photovoltaics, and for the study of electron behavior in solids.

<strong style="color:#800000;">New approach to calculate electron traffic jam in transition metal dichalcogenide</strong>
<br>
Though they both consist only of H2O molecules, water and ice exhibit apparently distinct characters: The former is solid and the latter is the very indispensible liquid for all living creature. Likewise, many materials of a given constituent in nature can exhibit different phases. Diamond and graphite are good examples. Both are made up of carbon atoms, but the former is transparent and electrically insulating while the latter looks black and conducts electricity. Now researchers at the MPSD and the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) in South Korea have found that the existing method to calculate a particular insulating state produces errors and suggest a new approach instead. Their work has been published in Physical Review Letters.

<strong style="color:#800000;">A step towards controlling spin-dependent petahertz electronics by material defects</strong>
<br>
The operational speed of semiconductors in various electronic and optoelectronic devices is limited to several gigahertz
(a billion oscillations per second).
This constrains the upper limit of the operational speed of computing.
Now researchers from the MPSD and the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay have explained
how these processes can be sped up through the use of light waves and defected solid materials.

Scientists from DESY, the MPSD, the University of Hamburg and the CUI Cluster of Excellence create high-order harmonics

The newly demonstrated technique might find intriguing applications in petahertz electronics and for spectroscopic studies of novel quantum materials.

Researchers from the Theory Department of the MPSD in Hamburg and North Carolina State University in the US

pulses in a three-dimensional class of magnetic materials dubbed pyrochlore iridates.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD)

with the same mechanism as atoms and molecules.
This makes two-dimensional materials an attractive alternative to atoms and molecules
for the generation of high-energy photons and ultrashort light pulses.
Their work has been published in Science Advances.<br>
